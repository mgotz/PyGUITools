This is a collection of tools to work with PyQt4 GUIs in python.
There are functions to load and save all the fields in an GUI, to make a simple matplotlib window and most interestingly a GUI handler for the python logger.
Credit for the logger goes mostly to Andreas Schuhman, from whom I shameless copied most of it.

Obviously depends on PyQt4, which, however, can not be specified as a dependency as it does not exist on PyPi.
